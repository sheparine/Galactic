This console applications will search a user's computer and search out matching phrases found within files within. 

Search patterns are in the form of regex expressions, and can be managed within the application's config.json file.

After a successful run, an output of matches is dumped in the bin folder; it's name is output.txt.

Have fun and happy searching!
